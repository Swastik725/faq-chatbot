# 🎓 University FAQ Chatbot

A smart FAQ Chatbot built using **React**, **FastAPI**, and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques. The chatbot helps users find answers to frequently asked university-related questions by matching their queries with a predefined FAQ database using **TF-IDF Vectorization** and **Cosine Similarity**.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The user enters a question in the chatbot interface.
2. The frontend sends the query to the FastAPI backend.
3. The backend preprocesses the query and converts it into a TF-IDF vector.
4. Cosine similarity is calculated between the user query and all stored FAQ questions.
5. The most relevant FAQ is selected.
6. If the similarity score is above a predefined threshold, the corresponding answer is returned.
7. Otherwise, the chatbot responds that no relevant answer was found.
